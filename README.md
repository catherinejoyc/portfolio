# Portfolio
This is a self developed portfolio website. I designed and built everything from scratch.
The homepage links to different single-page-websites that are designed for different purposes:

- /gamedev is a portfolio for job applications that offer a position in game development
- /programmer is a portfolio for job applications that offer a position as programmer or anything else IT related
- /webdev is a portfolio for job applications that offer a position as web developer (front end)
- /graphics is a portfolio for job applications that offer a position as graphic designer
